            <p>
                In short Saitama is a general-purpose discord bot. But what is a discord bot? It is server hosted application which is able to interact with a chat service called discord. Specifically, Saitama is able respond to certain messages keep track of interesting user statistics, execute commands such as ban, and once upon a time, Saitama was even able to play music. However, since discord kept updating their API, this function no longer works.
            </p>
            <h2>How?</h2>
            <img src="img/saitama/saitama-editor.png">
            <p>
                Since discord API was only available for python and JavaScript, I could only choose between those 2 languages. In the end, I decided to use python because I already had some prior knowledge of the language and it was easier to work with.
                <br><br>A virtual environment was created to store all necessary libraries for the project since I did not want to store them on my main machine. Some of these libraries include YouTube-dl for YouTube to mp3 capabilities, and obviously discord.py to connect to the discord servers.
                <br><br>.json files were used to store important information that might need to be changed in the future. These files are useful because they are easily accessible and alterable with code or by hand.
                <br><br>The overall structure of the project utilized several classes, each in charge of a different function. This way, the code did not get cluttered, and it was easy to navigate and read.
            </p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>
                I learned a lot about virtual environment, discord API, and general python. Starting out this project, I had no clue what a virtual environment was, no clue how to build a discord bot, and barely had any python experience. Now I can say that I am confident I would be able utilise these tools again.

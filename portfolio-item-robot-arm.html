      <p>
        In the ever-evolving world of robotics, innovation often springs from
        the minds of passionate individuals. This is the story of a solo journey
        into a captivating project—a Modular 4-DOF (Degrees of Freedom) 3D
        Printed Robotic Arm. As the sole member of the team, this endeavor
        became a testament to innovation, determination, and the power of modern
        manufacturing techniques.
      </p>
      <h2>A Solo Quest for Versatility and Affordability</h2>
      <p>
        <b>A Singular Objective:</b> My primary goal was straightforward—to
        create a modular robotic arm that would provide a versatile,
        cost-effective, and adaptable solution for various industries and
        applications. The vision was to ensure reliability, efficiency, and
        sustainability in every aspect. The crowning achievement would be the
        arm's modularity, allowing for the attachment of any tool for enhanced
        versatility.
      </p>
      <h2>From Concept to Creation</h2>
      <p>
        This ambitious project required a one-person orchestra, combining
        mechanical ingenuity with cutting-edge technology:
        <br /><br />
        <b>Design for Manufacturability (DFM):</b> Every component had to be
        meticulously designed to be 3D printed with ease. I paid particular
        attention to minimizing the need for supports, especially in critical
        areas like precision holes, to ensure efficient manufacturing.<br /><br />
        <b>Design for Assembly (DFA):</b> Simplifying the assembly process was
        crucial. With only screws, nuts, and force fits, the entire arm could be
        assembled, eliminating the need for specialized assembly equipment.
      </p>
      <h2>Section 1: Planetary Gear Drive - Crafting Precision and Power</h2>
      <img src="img/robot-arm/3.png" />
      <p>
        I delved into the world of involute gear design principles, applying
        this knowledge to parametrically model external and internal gears. This
        innovation amplified the base plate torque and precision by 4X.<br /><br />
        I chose herringbone ("V-shaped") gears for the planetary gearbox due to
        their silent, smooth, and efficient operation.
        <br /><br />
        The central location of the sun gear in the planetary drive allowed for
        an improved wire management system, streamlining wire routing.
      </p>
      <h2>Section 2: Cycloidal Gear Drive - A Compact Powerhouse</h2>
      <img src="img/robot-arm/4.png" />
      <p>
        I developed a compact, fully 3D printable cycloidal drive to increase
        the torque of the first vertical joint by a factor of 13.<br /><br />
        Countless iterations were made, adjusting parameters such as
        eccentricity and roller radius to develop a reliable, smooth, and
        efficient drive. <br /><br />
        I strategically selected the cycloidal drive over other types for its
        higher accuracy, load capacity, transmission efficiency, and
        compactness.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Section 3: Bevel Gear Differential Joint - Efficiency through Design
      </h2>
      <img src="img/robot-arm/5.png" />
      <p>
        I applied my knowledge of spur gears to design a parametric bevel gear
        set, approximating the tooth profile of the bevel gears using Tredgold’s
        approximation.
      </p>
      <h2>Section 4: Belt Drives - Transmitting Torque Across Distances</h2>
      <img src="img/robot-arm/6.png" />
      <p>
        I converted linear dimensions from a GT2 timing belt into radial
        dimensions and applied them to model a parametric GT2 timing belt
        gear.<br /><br />
        Parametric models created two sets of GT2 timing belt gears for torque
        transmission between distant parallel shafts.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Section 5: 3D Printable Cross Roller Bearings - Precision without the
        Price Tag
      </h2>
      <img src="img/robot-arm/7.png" />
      <p>
        I designed a parametric cross roller bearing model in SolidWorks, saving
        over $1000 by eliminating the need to purchase large-sized
        industrial-grade cross roller bearings.<br /><br />
        The choice of a cross roller bearing was deliberate, as it excels in
        handling both axial and radial loads.
      </p>
      <h2>Section 6: Structural Components - Efficiency in Printing</h2>
      <img src="img/robot-arm/8.png" />
      <p>
        To reduce print time and filament cost, I removed the need for supports
        on small horizontal holes by adding a 40-degree tip, ensuring they
        remained above the minimum printable angle threshold of 30 degrees.<br /><br />
        I conducted trials to determine the average shrinkage rate of various 3D
        printing filaments, leading to adjustments in critical dimensions for
        improved part accuracy. <br /><br />
        I employed "tree supports" to minimize filament consumption and enhance
        surface finish.
      </p>
      <h2>Section 7: Electronics - The Nervous System</h2>
      <img src="img/robot-arm/9.png" />
      <p>
        I implemented an Arduino microcontroller and ULN2003 driver to control a
        28BYJ-48 stepper motor, enabling testing of individual joints within the
        robot arm.<br /><br />
        I am currently in the process of creating an electrical system to
        operate a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor until a limit switch has been pressed,
        allowing for precise calibration of the robot arm. <br /><br />
